       **Credit Card Default Prediction**
This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing and predicting credit card default risk using advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA), behavioral trend analysis, financial feature analysis and  a binary classification model to predict customer default and thus aims to improve its credit risk management framework by developing a forward-looking Behaviour Score â€” a classification model that predicts whether a credit card customer will default in the following month.

          **Project Overview**
The repository covers the full data science workflow:
1.Data loading and preprocessing
2.Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3.Behavioral trend and financial risk analysis
4.Feature engineering and transformation
5.Model training, validation, and prediction
